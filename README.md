# Tacafe

The project consists of a **mobile application** compatible with iOS and Android that allows customers to order food at home from a
fictitious coffee shop. The application will connect to a NoSQL database in the cloud (Firebase) to store and manage product, user and order data.
The purpose of this project is to work with current technologies such as Flutter and non-relational databases in the cloud, apply and expand the knowledge acquired in the Higher Degree in Multiplatform Application Development.

## Getting Started

To start you must log in or create an **account**.

Once logged in you will see a **main screen** with all the cafe's available products. You can see small cards with a photo, the name of the product and the price.
On this screen you can **filter** by categories, or search for products.

You can add products to the cart and proceed with the purchase indicating the **address** and a **payment method**. Regarding payment methods, you can have more than one, storing them encrypted in the database.

Once the required fields are filled in, you can **place an order**. You can see the order history in the user's orders section. In this section you can modify user properties such as shipping address, name, phone number.

There is another section to see information **about the application** such as the version, the creator, methods to contact customer service, etc.

If you are an administrator you will be able to see a **hidden option** on the main screen to add, delete or modify products.

And finally a section to log out.
